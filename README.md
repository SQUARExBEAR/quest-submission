## Chapter 1 Day 1 Quest

### Explain what the Blockchain is in your own words. 
<br>The blockchain is a digital ledger that stores information electronically using blocks, or sets of information. Once a Block gets filled with data it is closed and linked to the previous block, which forms the chain of data known as the Blockchain

### Explain what a Smart Contract is. 
<br>A Smart Contract is a program, written into code, that runs on the blockchain. Smart Contracts are deployed onto the blockchain to allow the automation of an execution or workflow, once conditions have been met and verified.

### Explain the difference between a script and a transaction.
<br>A Script is used to view data on the blockchain. A Transaction takes in a payment and is used to change data on the blockchain.

## Chapter 1 Day 2 Quest

### What are the 5 Cadence Programming Language Pillars?
<br> 1. Safety and Security
<br> 2. Clarity 
<br> 3. Approachability
<br? 4. Developer Experience
<br> 5. Intuiting Ownership with Resources

### In your opinion, even without knowing anything about the Blockchain or coding, why could the 5 Pillars be useful (you don't have to answer this for #5)?
<br> All of the pillars are important in their own right, not just in coding, but in communication in general. Safety and Security is very important, not only in Web3, but in general. It is super important in Web3 however, because there are individuals transacting hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of USD through smart contracts every day and the more secure a Smart Contract, the more trust a userbase will have in the programs. Clarity is important in coding, as well as communication, because transparency is key to garnering trust. Approachability and Developer Experience go hand in hand, since all of us new coders will be new to Cadence so having a similar experience with other coding languages is important. The Ownership with Resources is important because of the nature of Smart Contracts and the fact that transactions for NFTs are so prevalent. Decentralization is key to the blockchain, after all.
